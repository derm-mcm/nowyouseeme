This is a small demo on using iohub to capture keyboard and mouse responses.
psychopy.iohub can be used to replace psychopy.event

psychopy.iohub is superior to psychopy.event in the following ways:
 * Listen for input while the main python session is busy with stimuli.
   This is good for timing!
 * Listen for keyboard releases and currently pressed keys.
 * Easily capture combinations of keys and the characters they return.

NOTE: If you're running Mac OS, you may need to elevate psychoopy's permissions
for iohub to work properly. Otherwise it will only capture moderator keys.

# Initiate keyboard

"""
EXERCISE:
    * Make a small script that waits until the subject has 
      written 'Dawg!' 
      Hint: (D, a, w, g, !).
      
    * Now start a psychopy Window with a TextStim that updates to show
      this in text, as if one was typing in a text field.
      (Maybe the text should turn green upon success?)
      
    * Pro: use keyboard.state to determine if the subject is currently
      holding down a, s, d, f, and g. 
      Hint: dict.keys() and set(lista) == set(listb)

io.wait(1)
io.clearEvents('all')

# iohub wait* methods above are identical to doing this, although they do 
# it in a different process than the main python session:
while True:
    events = keyboard.getEvents(iohub.EventConstants.KEYBOARD_RELEASE)  # listening for releases
    if events:  # if non-empty
        break

TO DO:
  * GETTING KEYBOARD RESPONSE DURING FLIP-LOOP.
  * MOUSE STUFF
