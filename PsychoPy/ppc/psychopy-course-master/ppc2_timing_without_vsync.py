"""
If your computer does not sync to vertical frames (show something strange in 
demos --> timing --> timesByFrames.py), you can hack yourself out of it. 
Here's the problem simulated and the fix. BEWARE that this will run fine 
90% of the time you start it but the last 10% is in the danger zone of trying 
to push frames at the exact update time of the monitor, thus causing a jitter 
in actual onset latency.
